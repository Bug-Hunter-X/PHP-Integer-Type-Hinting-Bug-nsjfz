This repository contains a simple PHP example that demonstrates a potential integer type hinting bug. The function `foo` is defined to take two integers as input and return an integer. However, under certain circumstances, this function could return a float or throw unexpected errors. This might not be obvious to developers relying solely on type hinting. The solution demonstrates how to ensure that the returned value is strictly an integer, preventing potential issues.
